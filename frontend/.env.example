# Frontend Environment Variables
# Copy this file to .env and update values for your environment

# ==================== API CONFIGURATION ====================
# URL of the backend API server
# Used by axios interceptor to make API calls
# 
# Development:
#   - Vite dev server: http://localhost:5173
#   - FastAPI backend: http://localhost:8000
#
# Production:
#   - Set to your production backend URL (e.g., https://api.example.com)
#   - CORS on backend must allow this frontend origin
#
# Note: In production, frontend and backend are typically served from same domain
# to avoid CORS issues. If serving from different domains, backend CORS_ORIGINS
# must include this frontend URL (see backend/.env.example)
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000

# ==================== OTHER FUTURE SETTINGS ====================
# (Reserved for future configuration needs)
# Examples:
# - Analytics tracking keys
# - Feature flags
# - Third-party service endpoints
# - Logging levels
